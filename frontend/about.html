  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm <strong>Maldhan Adhav</strong>, a passionate and experienced DevOps Engineer and Full Stack Developer based in India. With over 4 years of experience in both onsite and remote roles, I've worked across diverse environments to deliver scalable, secure, and automated solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I specialize in building and maintaining production-grade infrastructure using tools like AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. My full-stack experience allows me to develop complete web applications using React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey started in networking, where I earned CCNA and CCNP certifications. That strong foundation has helped me bridge the gap between development and operations. I'm always looking to learn new technologies and contribute to impactful projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy learning about cloud-native technologies, contributing to open-source, and mentoring aspiring engineers.
